## What Am I Looking At?
``` diff
```
*Donald J. Trump* is one of the most tweeting presidents in American history. 
According to the **INDEPENDENT**:
> Mr Trump has sent almost *500* tweets from his personal **@realDonaldTrump** account, 
and a further *300* from the official **@Potus** account since his inauguration on 20 January.
That amounts to almost *5* personal tweets a day, and combined with his
official account - which is albeit mostly managed by his staff - the figure reaches *7.5*.

He tweets about a broad range of subjects, including: news channels, reporters, business organizations, his family and even individuals. His tweets usually get lots of attentions from Twitter users and main stream medias.

Our application analyzes population's real time reaction to Trump's *Twitter* activity based on the content of the tweets concerning him.
